Charmed
=======

A cross-platform MVVM support library for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. Charmed isn't intended to replace your favorite MVVM library, but rather to substitute it. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 have some cool features, but they usually come with the cost of making your view models difficult to test. Charmed is intended to abstract those features out so that you can still use them, while keeping your presentation layer testable.
